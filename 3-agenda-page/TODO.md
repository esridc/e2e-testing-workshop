- on agenda page, start by selecting `.main-content:nth-child(6)` which is the course
- problem is this is a very brittle selector!
  - if the sort is different, we have a different course
- better... webdriver power selection tools
  - const header = $('h3=End-to-End Testing*')
- best - use data-test attributes that are stripped in production builds
